# Make Visma Administration more accessible
Visma Administration has some custom developed grids that are used as lists and editable lists. These grids implement a limited set of UIA properties to be accessible for screen readers.
This add on implements this for NVDA and also provides labelling for many of the textboxes, comboboxes and other controls used throughout the UI.

## Supported Editions And Versions
The add on can be used with Visma Administration 2000/1000/500/200, Visma Fakturering and Visma FÃ¶rening version 2020.0 and higher.
